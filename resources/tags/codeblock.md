Discord has support for Markdown, which allows you to post code with full syntax highlighting. Please use these whenever you paste code, as this helps improve the legibility and makes it easier for us to help you.

To do this, use the following method:

\```python
print('Hello world!')
\```

Note:  
• **These are backticks, not quotes.** Backticks can usually be found on the tilde key.  
• You can also use py as the language instead of python  
• The language must be on the first line next to the backticks with **no** space between them  

This will result in the following:
```py
print('Hello world!')
```
