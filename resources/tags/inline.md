**Inline codeblocks**

In addition to multi-line codeblocks, discord has support for inline codeblocks as well. These are small codeblocks that are usually a single line, that can fit between non-codeblocks on the same line.

The following is an example of how it's done:

The \`\_\_init\_\_\` method customizes the newly created instance.

And results in the following:

The `__init__` method customizes the newly created instance.

**Note:**  
• These are **backticks** not quotes  
• Avoid using them for multiple lines  
• Useful for negating formatting you don't want
