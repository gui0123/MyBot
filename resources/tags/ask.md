Asking good questions will yield a much higher chance of a quick response:

• Don't ask to ask your question, just go ahead and tell us your problem.  
• Don't ask if anyone is knowledgeable in some area, filtering serves no purpose.  
• Try to solve the problem on your own first, we're not going to write code for you.  
• Show us the code you've tried and any errors or unexpected results it's giving.  
• Be patient while we're helping you.
